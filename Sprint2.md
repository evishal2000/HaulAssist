# User Story: End-to-End Testing, Integration Testing, and Frontend-Backend Integration for HaulAssist

## As a development team member,
I want to perform comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) and integration testing for HaulAssist, and integrate the frontend with the backend,
So that we can ensure the reliability, functionality, and seamless interaction of our entire system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- E2E tests are written for all key user flows using Cypress
- Integration tests are created to verify interactions between frontend and backend
- Frontend is successfully integrated with backend APIs
- Test coverage includes main pages, authentication flow, and API interactions
- All tests pass successfully before code is merged into the main branch

## Tasks
- Develop E2E tests for main user flows
- Create integration tests for frontend-backend API interactions
- Set up Cypress for automated E2E testing
- Implement API mocking and real API tests for integration testing
- Integrate frontend components with backend APIs
- Ensure proper error handling and data flow between frontend and backend
- Debug and fix any failing tests or integrationÂ issues
