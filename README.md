# HaulAssist : An On-demand Delivery Service

Handling logistics and assistance tasks, such as transporting goods, managing luggage, or coordinating last-mile deliveries, can be both challenging and time-consuming. Travelers often deal with the hassle of carrying heavy bags at airports and train stations, small businesses encounter unreliable delivery services, and individuals frequently struggle to find trustworthy help for moving or transportation needs.  

Although the demand for solutions to this problem is rising, existing services are often scattered across various platforms, costly, or inconsistent in quality. This leaves users with limited options and unnecessary stress.  

HaulAssist can address these challenges by providing a unified, easy-to-use platform that connects users with reliable service providers for on-demand logistics and goods delivery. Our hope is to streamline the logistics of everyday tasks, making them quicker, easier, and more dependable.

HaulAssist will be implemented with a ReactJS front-end and a NodejS back-end.
